Simple Voice Chat

This is a simple voice chat app that acts somewhat like actual phone calls - one can call, one can accept a call, and one can talk to another while in a call.

modules:
	Client:
		The client is responsible for all network communications
		The client uses 2 udp sockets:
			1. responsible for receiving and sending connection requests, and when connected responsible for sending or receiving audio, depending on whether you 
		       are the requester or the listener of the voice chat conversationl
			2. responsible for receiving or sending audio depending on depending on whether you are the requester or the listener of the voice chat conversationl
		When not connected, the client has 2 modes of operation:
			- waiting: in this mode the client receives any incoming voice chat requests, and calls a callback which returns a boolean indicating whether or not the request was accepted
			- connecting: in this mode the client tries to connect to a requested endpoint
		When accepting a connection request the client starts the handshake which should use ECDH to achieve a shared secret and then use that to derive 
		2 different ChaCha20 streams, each with a different nonce, one for encypting the sent data and one for decrypting the received data.
